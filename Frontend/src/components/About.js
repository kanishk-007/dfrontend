      <p>Websites come in a nearly endless variety, including educational sites, news sites, porn sites, forums, social 
        media sites, e-commerce sites, and so on. The pages within a website are usually a mix of text and other media. 
        That said, there are no rules dictating the form of a website.A person could create a website of nothing but 
        black and white photos of roses, or the word "cat" linked to another Web page with the word "mouse.
        " However, many sites follow a standard pattern of a homepage that links off to other categories and content
        within the website.The homepage (or simply “home”) represents the main page of the site itself. Frequently, 
        the homepage is a sort of “hub” from which all other pages can be accessed. An internal web page to which 
        several other pages are linked in a coherent structure (such as a specific category of topics) is instead 
        called a “parent page.”Every page is a single HTML document, and all of them are connected through hyperlinks
        (or simply “link”) which can be combined in a navigation bar for ease of use.The navigation bar is displayed
        on every page rather than just the homepage, and allows the user to quickly move across the main website’s 
        structure.
