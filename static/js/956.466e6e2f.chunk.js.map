Frequently, \n        the homepage is a sort of “hub” from which all other pages can be accessed. An internal web page to which \n        several other pages are linked in a coherent structure (such as a specific category of topics) is instead \n        called a “parent page.”Every page is a single HTML document, and all of them are connected through hyperlinks\n        (or simply “link”) which can be combined in a navigation bar for ease of use.The navigation bar is displayed\n        on every page rather than just the homepage, and allows the user to quickly move across the main website’s \n        structure.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"],"names":["About","_jsxs","className","children","_jsx"],"sourceRoot":""}
