The pages within a website are usually a mix of text and other media. That said, there are no rules dictating the form of a website.A person could create a website of nothing but black and white photos of roses, or the word "cat" linked to another Web page with the word "mouse. " However, many sites follow a standard pattern of a homepage that links off to other categories and content within the website.The homepage (or simply \u201chome\u201d) represents the main page of the site itself. Frequently, the homepage is a sort of \u201chub\u201d from which all other pages can be accessed. An internal web page to which several other pages are linked in a coherent structure (such as a specific category of topics) is instead called a \u201cparent page.\u201dEvery page is a single HTML document, and all of them are connected through hyperlinks (or simply \u201clink\u201d) which can be combined in a navigation bar for ease of use.The navigation bar is displayed on every page rather than just the homepage, and allows the user to quickly move across the main website\u2019s structure.'})]})}}}]);
